Prior to the Civil War, most lawyers and judges were well educated in Greek and Roman classics, and since the late 19th century the study of law required ""a full possession of the general literature of ancient and modern times.” Focusing on law in literature rather than law as literature, this class explores legal themes found in fiction, plays, nonfiction, film and television—with the objective of exploring essential legal themes like ethics, morality, justice, equality, human rights, crime and punishment. The course emphasizes how these themes relate not only to literary works, but also to modern legal and ethical issues, and contemporary perceptions of jurisprudence. The course requires no prior legal knowledge, and it is not a course in the study of law. This course should be of interest to anyone who wants to engage with the role of law in culture, the legal and literary representation of justice, and how law uses language.
