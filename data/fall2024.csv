Effective strategic thinking is one of the highest level forms of applied intelligence. It requires a synoptic grasp of many variables and is inherently interactive — great commanders know how to get inside the heads of their enemies. War is perhaps the most demanding field in which strategic thinking is employed, but not the only one.
